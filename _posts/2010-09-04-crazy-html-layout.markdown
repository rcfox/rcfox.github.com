title: Crazy HTML Layout
---
I've decided to try something new for the look of my site. Rather than try to copy everyone else with a sidebar, header, etc., I'm going bare-bones, literally. What you see now is an idealized skeleton of the HTML of this site. I was a little worried that the HTML would obscure the content, but after making it a lighter colour, and shrinking the font size slightly, I think it works pretty well. What do you think?

I'm in the progress of getting away from using [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org) in favour of static HTML. Don't get me wrong- I liked DokuWiki, but I was barely using the wiki aspects of the software, and I was feeling hindered in the things that I wanted to be able to do.. Also, I don't want to have to mess around with PHP if I want to do something fancy.

Since I'm graduating soon, I'm also not sure of what's going to happen to my [university account](http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~rcfox), so I've decided to move over to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) for now. This will let me keep everything in text files in Git, and I can just push my changes to [GitHub](http://github.com) when I want to update.
