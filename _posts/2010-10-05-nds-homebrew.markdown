## Pathfinder ##

Draw a maze, and have the pathfinder app find its way through!

Green shows a location that was considered in the pathfinding algorithm, and blue shows the final path.

## Polynomial Plotter ##
Tap some points on the screen, and this Nintendo DS demo will draw a polynomial that goes through all of them.

## $1 Gesture Recognizer ##
This is a demo of the [1$ Gesture Recognition algorithm](https://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/), written for the Nintendo DS.

Each gesture is drawn with one stroke. That is, once you lift the stylus, the gesture is done. 
The demo is currently trained to recognize the entire alphabet, in the style most similar to how I write. This will probably cause problems for other people...
