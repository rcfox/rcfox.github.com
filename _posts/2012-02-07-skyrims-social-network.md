The Skyrim Creation Kit was released today, so I decided to play with it a bit.

It turns out that the NPC relationships are more detailed than I had expected! You get things like "So-and-so is What's-his-face's mother-in-law, and they're allies." Also unexpected: you can export this data as tab-separated text file! Naturally, I had to compile a "social network" graph of Skyrim.

[Here's the result!](http://rcfox.ca/Skyrim-NPC-Relationship-Parser/)

    (I'm planning to write a bit more about this in the future...)
