              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Extended and integrated ngspice (an electronics simulator) and ADMS (a Verilog-A transpiler) into Upverter to allow users to verify their designs.</li>
            <li>Periodically profiled our code to find memory and run-time performance optimizations.
              <ul>
                <li>On a few occasions, I worked with the authors of third-party libraries to address performance issues in their code.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Assured code quality through rigorous code review and by annotating the JavaScript code base with static type checking directives.</li>
